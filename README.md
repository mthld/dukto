# Dukto, a multi-platform LAN file sharing
This repository is an attempt to resurrect this very nice project from [Emanuele Colombo (@colomboe)](https://github.com/colomboe).

Below the original description and message taken from: https://www.msec.it/blog/dukto/

UPDATE: this project is no longer maintained. You can download it and use it if it works on your devices, but I can’t provide any update and support anymore. I won’t provide also any security or bugfix update.

Dukto is one of my long-lived software project, it’s now at the 6th release, with many improvements over the previous versions. One of the main changes of this release is the new user interface inspired to the Metro style UI developed by Microsoft for the new releases of Windows Phone, Windows, Xbox and all the other Microsoft products. Since I like the simplicity, the essentiality of this kind of UI, I’ve decided to make a new Dukto interface for all the supported platforms.

If you don’t know Dukto, I can tell you that it’s an easy file transfer tool designed for LAN use. I use it in my everyday work to transfer files from one PC (or other device) to another, without worrying about users, permissions, operating systems, protocols, clients, servers and so on… Just start Dukto on the two PCs and transfer files and folders by dragging onto its window. That’s all.

Dukto main features are:
- Simple user interface
- No server or internet connection needed
- Zero configuration
- Clients auto-discovery
- High speed file transfer
- Multi-OS native support
- Portable version available
- Multi files and folders transfer
- Transfers log
- Send and receive text snippets (eg. useful for sending URLs)
- Open received files directly from the application
- Windows 7 taskbar integration with progress and transfer indicator
- Show your IP addresses on the IP connection page
- Full Unicode support
- Metro style UI
- Free and open source

Dukto is a free open source project, licensed under GPL. Official releases are made by me for the following platforms:
- Windows (XP or later)
- OS X (10.6.x or later)
- Linux (packaged for Ubuntu and Fedora)
- Symbian (for Nokia touch phones)


Also there are porting made by other developers, like the following:
- iPhone and other iOS devices, developed by Tidal ArtWorks
- RIM Playbook on Blackberry AppWorld, ported by Sacha Refshauge (seems broken at the moment)
- New BlackBerry app on AppWorld byÂ Marden Laairoy
- OpenPandora, ported by EyeCreate Studios
- Maemo, made by the Maemo community

You can find the source code on the project page http://sourceforge.net/projects/dukto/ at SourceForge.net. Dukto has also been tested and certified by Softpedia, Brothersoft and GearDownload.
